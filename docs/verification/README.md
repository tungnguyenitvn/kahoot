# Verification status

Current status per gate, rewritten in place after each run
([ADR 0005](../adr/0005-evidence-location.md)). Per-change evidence lives in the PR;
historical records in this directory are immutable. "Revision" is the commit whose tree
was verified: a later documentation-only commit does not invalidate a gate, a code
change does.

| CI (GitHub Actions) | .github/workflows/ci.yml | BLOCKED: run 35887767601 ended in startup_failure before any job started; a minimal echo-only probe workflow on a temporary branch failed the same way (run 35888361714), so the cause is account-side (Actions on a private repository, billing or spending limit), not the workflow files, which parse locally | 8ce5941 | github.com, private repository | 2026-09-23 | https://github.com/tungnguyenitvn/kahoot/actions/runs/35887767601 |
